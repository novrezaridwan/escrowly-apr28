                        <p className="service-page-description">When it comes to complex crypto transactions—especially those involving long-term deliverables or multi-phase services—trust, timing, and transparency become paramount. Milestone Transactions from Escrowly provide the necessary solution for such situations. The feature empowers all parties by allowing them to split a transaction into separate stages for payment releases that happen only after successful completion of each stage.</p>

                                <h3>What Are Milestone Transactions?</h3>
                                <p>Milestone-based payments protect all parties involved during cross-border crypto escrow, large-scale freelancing, and decentralized escrow services for development contract services.</p>
                                <p>Every phase of the transaction receives specific funds deposited into an escrow account. The service provider or seller receives their payment from Escrowly after the agreed completion conditions have been met.</p>
                                <p>This systematic framework reduces both parties' risks while developing long-lasting trust between them; thus benefiting crypto deals of high value and long duration. Through Escrowly’s crypto escrow for businesses, clients can structure payments according to project achievement milestones to prevent payment defaults and disappointment among parties.</p>
                                <h3>Why Use Milestone Transactions for Crypto Escrow?</h3>
                                <p>The main drawback of fast cryptocurrency payments is their permanent nature because transactions become irreversible. After transferring funds you cannot retrieve them. Milestone-based escrow systems revolutionize the industry because of their ability to change the game. It offers:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Better accountability:</strong> The payment process requires sellers to fulfill each defined stage before receiving compensation.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Improved buyer confidence:</strong> Payments remain totally unavailable before completion.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Dispute prevention: Contact</strong> issues during project development become easier to address at every stage rather than waiting until project completion.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Efficient project management:</strong> The process of project management becomes more efficient through this approach by dividing complex deals into smaller segments.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Escrowly merges milestone contracts with crypto escrow features to provide users with unmatched security for their short-term work and extended partnerships.</p>
                                <h3>Ideal Use Cases for Escrowly Milestone Escrow</h3>
                                <p>Milestone transactions adapt effectively to numerous crypto business situations. Milestone payments deliver control over risk and delivery standards for developers creating dApps,  companies acquiring custom hardware, and international organizations using smart contract escrow.</p>
                                <h6>1.Freelance Projects</h6>
                                <p>You can prevent the loss of crypto payments by implementing protection methods when working with remote contractors. Project stages should be divided into multiple payment milestones for design, followed by development, then testing, and delivery completion.</p>
                                <h6>2. Software & App Development</h6>
                                <p>Payment to developers can be made only when they finish delivering each functional segment. Blockchain escrow service provides an optimal solution for such.</p>
                                <h6>3.Cross-border Equipment Procurement</h6>
                                <p>You can opt to split up your machinery, industrial, or electronic equipment payments into three parts: inspection stage, shipping period, and delivery end point.</p>
                                <h6>4.Contractor Work</h6>
                                <p>Milestone escrow allows you to make payments through our USDT escrow service for the completion of stages of installation work, construction, and engineering projects.</p>
                                <h6>5.Crypto Escrow for Corporate Mergers</h6>
                                <p>Companies should segregate complex transaction phases such as mergers or acquisitions into review, approval cycles, and transfer completion.</p>
                                <h6>6.High Value Worth Domain Names</h6>
                                <p>Domain Investors selling domain names to third parties who wanted to pay in few months or a year until the domain name is transferred to that party and all payments are completed.</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li><strong>Buyer and Seller Agree on Terms</strong> – Both parties define milestones and payment conditions.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Buyer Funds the Transaction</strong> – The agreed amount is securely held in escrow.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Seller Completes Each Milestone</strong> – Payments are released incrementally as milestones are met.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Final Payment and Completion</strong> – Upon final approval, the remaining funds are transferred.</li>
                                </ol>
                                <p>Both the Buyer and Seller must also agree on how the escrow fees will be covered—either by the Buyer, Seller, or shared equally.</p>
                                <h3>How Domain Name Holding works</h3>
                                <ul>

                                    <li>Transparency for Sellers – Confidence that payment is secured in escrow.</li>
                                    <li>Protection for Buyers – Assurance that their money is safe until milestones are fulfilled.</li>
                                    <li>Lower Risk of Fraud – Transactions are monitored and regulated.</li>
                                    <li>Flexibility – Can be used for a variety of goods and services.</li>
